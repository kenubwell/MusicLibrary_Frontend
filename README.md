This was a React project for devCodeCampâ€™s Full Stack Developers bootcamp program. This is Part II of a two-part project and serves as the front-end coding requirements. It entailed utilizing the Axios HTTP library to making API calls to the backend (Django and MySQL) to incorporate a full-stack application with a Music Library theme.

Technologies: React, HTML/CSS, Axios, and Postman

Resources: Web Services, Request & Axios, Promises, and Intro to React (Lecture)
